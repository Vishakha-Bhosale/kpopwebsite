<h2><center> What is K-pop?</center></h2>
<p>
K-pop (abbreviation of Korean pop; Korean: 케이팝) is a genre of popular music originating in South Korea.
While the modern form of K-pop can be traced back to the early 90s, the term itself has been popularized since the 2000s,
replacing the term Gayo (가요), which also refers to domestic pop music in South Korea. Although it 
generally indicates "popular music" within South Korea, the term is often used in a narrower sense to describe
a modern form of South Korean pop that is influenced by styles and genres from around the world, such as
experimental, rock, jazz, gospel, hip hop, R&B, reggae, electronic dance, folk, country, and classical on top 
of its traditional Korean music roots. The more modern form of the genre emerged with the formation of one 
of the earliest K-pop groups, Seo Taiji and Boys, in 1992. Their experimentation with different styles and genres
of music and integration of foreign musical elements helped reshape and modernize South Korea\'s contemporary music
scene.</p><p>K-pop (abbreviation of Korean pop; Korean: 케이팝) is a genre of popular music originating in South Korea.

Hallyu has been building for two decades, but K-pop in particular has become increasingly visible to global audiences in the past five to 10 years. South Korean artists have hit the Billboard Hot 100 chart at least eight times since the Wonder Girls first cracked it in 2009 with their crossover hit “Nobody” — released in four different languages, including English — and the export of K-pop has ballooned South Korea’s music industry to an impressive $5 billion industry.</p>';
